## Objective
Develop an interactive visualization about the current Brazilian federal senate and its senators. Each senator is represented by a circle:
- The color of each circle must represent the political party of the corresponding senator
- The on-hover behavior of the circle must put its border in evidence
- The on-click behavior must show the name, party and photo of the corresponding senator to the user

## Data
The data used in the project were obtained from the open data website of the Brazilian Federal Senate.
